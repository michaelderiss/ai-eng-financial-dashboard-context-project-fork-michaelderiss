Building context from an existing project - Financial dashboard
🎯 The Challenge

Your team receives a repository that already contains a frontend and backend implementation, but the handover is incomplete: there is very little product documentation, almost no explicit coding standards, and no reliable project memory artifact for future contributors.

Instead of rebuilding the application, your mission is to use AI as a technical collaborator to understand the repository, define engineering rules, and document operational memory so the project can be maintained safely. You are expected to work from evidence found in the codebase, not assumptions about product behavior.

The tech lead has defined a delivery sequence that must be followed exactly:

Required workflow
Fork the repository: https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/ai-eng-financial-dashboard-context-project and prepare your local environment.
Ask your AI assistant for a project summary and validate that summary against the real repository structure and code.
Read the generated AI content and verify that it is aligned with your own understanding of the repository.
Commit each major step in a separate commit (no bundled mega-commit for the whole project).
Identify good and bad engineering practices in the codebase and turn them into explicit project rules.
Document those rules inside .agents/rules and iterate until the rules are applicable to the project's real workflow.
Generate a memory-bank folder with at least:
Product description
Tech stack
Current project status

Your output should read like professional repository stewardship, not like generic notes written without code inspection.

🌱 How to Start the Project
Fork this repository into your own GitHub account:
https://github.com/4GeeksAcademy/ai-eng-financial-dashboard-context-project
Clone your fork locally (or open it in GitHub Codespaces).
Validate the available services:
Frontend: http://localhost:5173
Backend: http://localhost:8000
API docs: http://localhost:8000/docs

🖥️ What You Need to Do
Phase 1 — Understand the handover
Fork and clone the project repository.
Inspect the repository structure and identify key folders, services, and entry points.
Ask your AI assistant for a summary of the project.
Read the generated summary and verify that it matches what you understood from the real codebase.
Validate and correct the AI summary with direct evidence from the codebase.
Create a dedicated commit for this phase.
Phase 2 — Analyze engineering practices
Review the codebase and identify at least 5 good practices and 5 bad or risky practices.
Group findings by category (architecture, naming, testing, documentation, DX, etc.).
Define a proposed ruleset that addresses detected risks and preserves useful patterns.
Create a dedicated commit for this phase.
Phase 3 — Implement repository rules
Create the .agents/rules directory if it does not exist.
Add rule files that reflect your proposed standards (clear naming, scope, and rationale).
Validate each rule by testing if it can actually guide real tasks in this repository.
Refine rules that are ambiguous, too generic, or disconnected from real project workflows.
Create a dedicated commit for this phase.
Phase 4 — Build project memory
Create a memory-bank folder at repository root.
Add a product overview document based on verifiable repository evidence.
Add a tech stack document (frontend, backend, infra/tooling, and key dependencies).
Add a current status document (implemented features, known gaps, and next priorities).
Create a dedicated commit for this phase.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Do not center your delivery on explaining the app in depth. Center it on repository understanding quality, practical governance rules, and maintainability artifacts.

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Every listed phase must have its own commit. If your history has one large commit for multiple phases, the project is incomplete.

✅ What We Will Evaluate
The repository was correctly forked and worked locally with Docker.
The AI-generated summary exists and was validated/corrected against real code evidence.
Commit history reflects separate commits per phase.
Good and bad practices were identified with concrete examples.
Proposed rules are documented inside .agents/rules and are actionable.
Rule validation demonstrates real applicability to this project workflow.
memory-bank exists and includes:
Product description
Tech stack
Current status
Documentation quality is specific, structured, and tied to repository reality.

Note: Visual redesign, feature expansion, and major refactors are not required for this project unless they are strictly necessary to validate a rule.
